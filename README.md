## About

The extensions in this package help you integrate Mastodon with your site. Currently, the following extensions are included:

* [**Fediverse - Mastodon Feed** (Module)](docs/mod_fediversefeed.md). Displays the public Mastodon feed of a user. Supports media (images and videos), as well as content warnings on the entire toot or just each media item.
* [**Content - Embed Toot** (Plugin)](docs/plg_content_fediverse.md). A plugin to embed toots in articles, Custom HTML modules, and third party extensions which support Joomla's standard content events.

## Accessibility matters

I am taking accessibility very seriously into consideration when writing this software. I want my software to be as inclusive as humanly possible.

Unfortunately, I am not an accessibility expert. I do the best I can, using my understanding of often conflicting or possibly outdated information. I am also human and do make mistakes.

If you have found an accessibility issue you are affected by please do let me know. I will do my best to cater for you. Together, we can make the web a better place, one small software module at a time.
