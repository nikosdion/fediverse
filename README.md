## About

This is a package of Joomla!‚Ñ¢ extensions which allow you to integrate Mastodon and ActivityPub in meaningful ways with your Joomla! site.

There are three levels of integration which can be used concurrently or independently of each other:
* **Consume**. You can display Mastodon posts and streams on your site.
* **Announce**. You can announce your Mastodon presence on your own site so that users who have your username and domain name can follow you on Mastodon, without having to explicitly tell them in advance your Mastodon handle.
* **Publish**. You can publish your own site's content into the Fediverse. Any ActivityPub user (Mastodon, PeerTube, Pixelfed, Tumblr, ‚Ä¶) can ‚Äúfollow‚Äù an account on your site and see your site's posts in their feed.

Unlike other microblogging / social media integration extensions there is no privacy-invading JavaScript, no need for cookie banners, no centralised control of the published content. You are in full control of your content.
