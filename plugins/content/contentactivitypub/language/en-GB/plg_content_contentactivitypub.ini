PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_OBJECT_TYPE_LABEL="ActivityPub Object Type"
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_OBJECT_TYPE_DESC="Choose the type of ActivityPub object for Joomla articles. The semantically correct type is Article <em>but</em> it's not properly supported by Mastodon (only the article title is displayed, updates to the article are not honoured, etc). Using Note is semantically incorrect <em>but</em> it's fully supported by Mastodon. If you are going to be federating mostly with Mastodon servers please leave this set to Note. If you are going to be federating with other kinds of ActivityPub software (e.g. Write Freely) set this to the semantically more accurate Article."
