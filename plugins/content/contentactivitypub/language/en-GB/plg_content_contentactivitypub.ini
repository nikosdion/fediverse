PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB="Content - ActivityPub integration for Joomla articles"
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_XML_DESCRIPTION="Makes public Joomla articles available in ActivityPub."

PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_OBJECT_TYPE_LABEL="ActivityPub Object Type"
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_OBJECT_TYPE_DESC="Choose the type of ActivityPub object for Joomla articles. The semantically correct type is Article <em>but</em> it's not properly supported by Mastodon (only the article title is displayed, updates to the article are not honoured, etc). Using Note is semantically incorrect <em>but</em> it's fully supported by Mastodon. If you are going to be federating mostly with Mastodon servers please leave this set to Note. If you are going to be federating with other kinds of ActivityPub software (e.g. Write Freely) set this to the semantically more accurate Article."
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_OBJECT_TYPE_NOTE="Note"
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_OBJECT_TYPE_ARTICLE="Article"

PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_FULLTEXT_LABEL="Displayed Content"
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_FULLTEXT_DESC="Which part of a Joomla article do you want to be included in the ActivityPub activity entry?"
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_FULLTEXT_OPT_INTROTEXT="Intro text"
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_FULLTEXT_OPT_FULLTEXT="Full text"
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_FULLTEXT_OPT_BOTH="Both intro and full text"
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_FULLTEXT_OPT_METADESC="Meta description"

PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_URL_LABEL="Article URL"
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_URL_DESC="Choose if and how to include a URL to your article in the federated content. “None” means no URL will be included. “URL Field” adds the URL as a field to the ActivityPub object; Mastodon displays it as plain text (not linked) at the bottom of the post. “Link” includes the URL as a clickable ‘Read more’ link at the end of the post. “Both” combines “URL Field” and “Link” for the best compatibility with all ActivityPub-enabled servers."
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_URL_NONE="None"
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_URL_URL="URL Field"
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_URL_LINK="Link"
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_URL_BOTH="Both"

PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_IMAGES_LABEL="Include Images As Attachments"
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_IMAGES_DESC="Should the intro and/or full text images be included as attachments to the activity? <strong>Only images applied in Joomla's Images tab are taken into account</strong>. Images placed inline your content text will <strong>NOT</strong> be included as attachments and will <strong>not</strong> be displayed by most federated ActivityPub servers (such as Mastodon instances)."

PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_IMMEDIATE_NOTIFICATION_LABEL="Process queue immediately"
PLG_CONTENT_CONTENTACTIVITYPUB_IMMEDIATE_NOTIFICATION_DESC="When you create, edit, publish, or unpublish a content item the plugin enqueues notifications for federated servers (so that your followers can see your activity). When this option is disabled these notifications will only be processed by the scheduled task you've created using the “Task - ActivityPub” plugin. When this option is enabled the processing will start immediately — meaning that edit operations on articles <em>will appear to be slower</em> by up to 10 seconds."
