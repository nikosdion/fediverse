# Accessibility statement

I am taking accessibility very seriously into consideration when writing this software. I want my software to be as inclusive as humanly possible.

Unfortunately, I am not an accessibility expert. I do the best I can, using my understanding of often conflicting or possibly outdated information. I am also human and do make mistakes.

If you have found an accessibility issue you are affected by please do let me know. I will do my best to cater for you. Together, we can make the web a better place, one small software module at a time.
